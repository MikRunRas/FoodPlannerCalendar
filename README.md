# FoodPlannerCalendar

Food Planner Calendar App

My wife and I like to plan our dinners for a week at a time. 
This can sometimes prove to be a tiring task, and as such, I wanted to make an application that can generate such a plan for us.

Furthermore, we are also tired of not having a common calendar that we can share with eachother.
I figured that this could also be added to my food planner app, as it would alreadt need some kind of calendar, for the food plan.

As such, my application will have the following requirements:

1. The app should be able to generate a personalized food plan, based on the users preferences. 
   These could be things such as the user being vegetarian, wanting fish twice a week, meat free days and so on.
   When generating a food plan, a shopping list will also be generated.
2. Share a calendar with other users, and be able to add things to this calendar.
3. Sign up as a user.
4. Follow other users.
5. Share your calendar and shopping list.
6. Create a family, letting all members of the family edit a shopping list or food plan.
7. Let the user specify what they already have in their fridge, making the shoppinglist adapt to this.
